# Neosensory--feedback-system-for-Assistive-Walking-technology
The motors will be connected to the patient's body and will make the user move. The sensory feedback will be provided by the gyroscope and accelerometer  connected to the patient's body. There will be an array of force effective sensors connected to the patient's foot. The sensor array gives feedback to the Neurosensory Buzz so that the user will get a sense of each step and will improve the walking time and overall walking  pattern.
The device is used along with the open-source Exosuit project to provide better rehabilitation for people.
